Fantasy Premier League Analysis

In this project, our task is to analyze the events occurring during football matches of the English Premier League
(EPL). The matches are streamed using Streaming Spark and the events of each match (passes, fouls, goals, shots,
duels) are processed. One batch of data is a match and all the events that took place in the match. Different player
metrics (pass accuracy, free kick effectiveness, shots on target, duel efficiency, fouls and own goals) are calculated
for every match and depending on these metrics, the player ratings and chemistry between the players are
updated. Once all the matches are streamed, the user interface tasks (extracting player information, displaying
match details and predicting winning chances for a match between any two given teams) are processed.
